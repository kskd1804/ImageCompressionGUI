# ImageCompressionGUI
This is one of my free time projects. It uses various classes present in ImageIO package in java to compress an input image.

Steps to compress images:
1. Compile the Main.java file (javac Main.java) to generate the object file (Main.class)
2. Execute the program by typing: java Main
3. Click Browse and select an image to compress.
4. Click compress
